We analyzed the draft targets as circulated to All Permanent
Representatives and Permanent Observers to the United Nations New York
in the zero draft of the post 2015 outcome document entitled
"Transforming our World by 2030 - a New Agenda for Global Action" on
July 2nd 2015 in letter by *Sam K. Kutesa* on behalf of the
Co-Facilitators of the intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015
development agenda *Macharia Kamau* Permanent Representative Permanent
Mission of the Republic of Kenya to the United Nations and *David
Donoghue* Permanent Representative Permanent Mission of Ireland to the
United Nations. The circulated draft included a number of proposed
revisions to the zero draft targets. While we use the targets as
circulated on June 2, we conduct supplementary to test the sensitivity
of the results to the inclusio of those proposed revisions.
